Sudoku Solver using Knuth's Algorithm X.

Inspired partly by the approach used here: https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~aassaf9/python/algorithm_x.html

Of course I took my own approach, as the goal of the original constraint satisfaction version of this program was speed.

Current worst case time of 0.078 seconds on my machine, avg case: 0.025s.
